What is it?
===========

test_kmod is a simple tool that takes a compiled .ko module, "loads" it using
mmap() and apply relocations the same way it is done by the Linux kernel. The
undefined external symbols are them resolved to "stub" functions implemented by
test_kmod itself (see stubs.c).

This allows controlling the module inputs, and can be useful for unit testing,
debugging (using GDB), memory checking (using valgrind) and code coverage
(using gcov+lcov).
